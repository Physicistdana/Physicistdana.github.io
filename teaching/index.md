# Teaching

Iâ€™ve taught and supported introductory physics for STEM and life sciences major, with an emphasis on active learning and clear problem-solving frameworks.


## Past


## Teaching Philosophy
I aim for concept-first intuition, structured practice, and inclusive classrooms. Students learn best when they can predict, test, and discuss ideas with frequent feedback.
